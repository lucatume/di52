# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [unreleased] Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fixed `Container::unsetOffset` method behavior to ensure singletons and when-needs-gives bindings are correctly removed.

## [4.0.0] 2024-12-14;

### Changed

- Bumped minimum supported version to PHP 7.1.
- Fixed PHP 8.4 deprecation warnings.

## [3.3.7] 2024-04-26;

### Fixed

- Correctly bind the container to the builders and resolvers when cloning the container.

## [3.3.6] 2024-04-02;

### Added

- The `afterBuildAll` parameter to the `bindDecorators` and `singletonDecorators` method, fixes #61.

## [3.3.5] 2023-09-01;

### Changed

- Added [PHPStan generics](https://phpstan.org/blog/generics-in-php-using-phpdocs) to multiple classes. IDEs that support them will get autocompletion (.phpstorm.meta.php not required) if a fully-qualified class name is used, e.g. `$instance = $container->get( Test::class );`. 

## [3.3.4] 2023-06-20;

### Added

- Implement the `Container::__clone` method to clone the container accessory classes correctly upon cloning.

### Changed

- The `Container::__construct` method will bind itself to the `Psr\Container\ContainerInterface` interface as a singleton.
- If the `Container` class is extended, it will bind itself to the extended class in the `__construct` and `__clone` methods.

## [3.3.3] 2023-04-28;

### Fixed

- Return value of the `App::callback` method to be `callable` (thanks @estevao90).

## [3.3.2] 2023-04-07;

### Fixed

- Set the correct return type for the `Container::callback` function (thanks @estevao90).

## [3.3.1] 2023-03-17;

### Fixed

- Allow bound interfaces to properly resolve their concrete class when the concrete class has contextual bindings (thanks @defunctl). e.g. the following will now work properly:

```php
$container = new \lucatume\DI52\Container();
$container->bind(SomeInterface::class, SomeClass::class);
$container->when(Someclass:class)
    ->needs('$num')
    ->give(20);

// This now works, properly resolving SomeClass::class.
$instance = $container->get(SomeInterface::class);
```

## [3.3.0] 2023-02-28;

### Breaking change

- Removed the `aliases.php` file from the package autoloading. Take a look at the README.md file to see how to gracefully upgrade to version 3.3

## [3.2.1] 2023-02-28;

### Fixed

- Correctly resolve unbound parameters to default value when available.

## [3.2.0] 2023-02-27;

### Changed

- Allow customization of rethrown exceptions catpured during container resolution; alter message, file and line by default.

### Fixed

- Some `App` generated methods signatures.

## [3.1.1] 2023-02-16;

### Changed
- Removed leftover `@since TBD` comments.

## [3.1.0] 2023-01-28;

### Added
- PHP8.2 support.
- Parameter detection support for PHP Union Types.
- Parameter Enum detection/Enum container resolving.
- thanks @defunctl.

### Changed
- Add PHP8.2 to GitHub workflow matrix.
- Separated tests into a `unit` suite and a `php81` suite to avoid fatal parse errors when asserting enums.
- Updated GitHub workflows to remove deprecated functionality and run composer install via https://github.com/ramsey/composer-install.
- Updated GitHub workflows to attempt to automatically migrate the phpunit configuration file based on the current version being run.
- Updated deprecated "actions/checkout" GitHub action from v2 to v3.
- thanks @defunctl.

### Fixed
- Use the correct PHP version ID to ensure `PHP81ContextualBindingContainerTest` runs under PHP8.1.
- Fixed the phpunit.xml schema to validate against phpunit 5.7.
- Fatal Error Handling snapshots.
- thanks @defunctl.


## [3.0.3] 2023-01-24;

### Added
- The container now registers Service Providers using its own `Container::get()` method, instead of the `new` keyword. This allows Service Providers to utilize dependency injection. (thanks @defunctl).
- Additional contextual binding examples for primitives + service provider documentation in the README.

## [3.0.2] 2023-01-20;

### Added
- Add support for resolving primitive values (e.g. int, string, bool etc...) using `Container::when()`, `Container::needs()` and `Container::give()` (thanks @defunctl).

## [3.0.1] 2022-11-16;

### Changed
- Add `.gitattributes` file to exclude development artifacts. (thanks @Luc45)

## [3.0.0] 2022-02-09;

### Changed
- Add support for a default value in the `lucatume\DI52\Container::getVar(string $key, mixed $default = null)
:mixed` method.
- The `lucatume\DI52\Container::setVar(string $key, mixed $value) :void` will **not** try to run callables when
storing variables on the container using the method. As such, the need to protect the variables when using
the `setVar()` method is no more required.
- The `lucatume\DI52\Container::tagged(string $tag) :array` method will now return an empty array if nothing was
tagged with the tag; it would throw an error in previous versions.
- Rewritten the code to fully leverage Closure support.
- Move build tools to Docker.
- Make the container implementation compatible with [PSR-11 Container specification](https://www.php-fig.
org/psr/psr-11/)
- Fix #26 to handle and format files syntax errors while trying to autoload.
- Fix #13 and allow explicit definition of default binding method.
- Allow getting the registered provider instances using `getProvider` and `get`, `make` or the `ArrayAccess` API.
- Allow getting callbacks for static and instance methods consistently to unhook.
- Add phstan, phan and phpcs checks.
- Move benchmarks to Docker, automate them.
- Update documentation and examples.

### Removed
- Removed the `tad_DI52_ServiceProviderInterface` and `tad_DI52_ContainerInterface` interfaces.
